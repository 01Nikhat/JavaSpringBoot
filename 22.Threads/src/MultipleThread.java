/*
-------------------- THREADS IN JAVA --------------------

ðŸ“Œ What is a Thread?
- A thread is a lightweight sub-process.
- It is the smallest unit of execution in a program.
- Threads allow **parallel execution** of tasks.
- By default, every Java program runs with one thread â†’ called the "main thread".

ðŸ“Œ Why do we use Threads?
- To perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- To make programs faster and more efficient (e.g., downloading a file while playing music).

ðŸ“Œ Ways to create a Thread in Java:
1. Extending the Thread class
2. Implementing the Runnable interface

Here, we are using **extending Thread class**.

     ðŸ”¹ run() method:
     - Every threadâ€™s task must be written inside the run() method.
     - When we call start(), JVM internally calls run().
     - We NEVER call run() directly for thread execution (that will just act like a normal method).

class B extends Thread { // Another thread class
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello"); // Task for Thread B

        /*
         ðŸ”¹ Output:
         - "Hi" and "Hello" will appear mixed.
         - Why? Because JVM gives CPU time to both threads.
         - CPU switches rapidly between threads â†’ looks parallel.
         - Actual order depends on OS thread scheduler, so output is unpredictable.

/*
-------------------- KEY POINTS --------------------
âœ… Thread is created by extending Thread class or implementing Runnable.
âœ… run() â†’ contains task logic.
âœ… start() â†’ creates a new thread and calls run() internally.
âœ… Execution order is decided by thread scheduler â†’ not in our control.
âœ… With threads, multiple tasks execute in parallel (multithreading).
